And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until it gets so ugly you can hardly bear to look at it.

Talk happiness.  The world is sad enough
      Without your woe. No path is wholly rough.
      Look for the places that are smooth and clear,
      And speak of them to rest the weary ear
      Of earth; so hurt by one continuous strain
      Of mortal discontent and grief and pain...
Talk health.  The dreary, never-ending tale
      Of mortal maladies is worn and stale;
      You cannot charm or interest or please
      By harping on that minor chord, disease.
      Say you are well, or all is well with you,
      And God shall hear your words and make them true.

A nasty day! A nasty day!
'Twas thus I heard a critic say
Because the skies were bleak and gray—
And yet it somehow seemed to me
The day was all that it should be.
I looked it very closely o'er;
Its hours still were twenty-four,
With sixty minutes each—no less—
For deeds of good and helpfulness;
And every second full of chance
To give the day significance;
And every hour full of growth
For everybody but the sloth—
I couldn't see it quite that way,
For though the skies were bleak and gray
The day itself, it seemed to me,
Was all a day could rightly be.

I like the man who takes the stones
Upon his rocky road
With smiling lips instead of groans,
Whate'er his heavy load
Who seizes each as on he goes,
And neatly crumbles it,
And turns his share of pebbly woes
To stores of inner grit.
~John Kendrick Bangs (1862-1922), "Transformation" (February Fifteenth), The Cheery Way: A Bit of Verse For Every Day, 1920


[B]eing flexible ensures that you meet with no limitations. It is often in the things you cannot change that you discover life's power to guide you. In a concrete world of mechanical sounds, you may forget that you are a natural creature in the great river of life. When a floating leaf encounters an obstacle, it begins to move in a circle. The potential power captured in the latent energy of the leaf as it turns in circles, reveals how you can access enormous energy by simply letting go. Let go and simply fall back into the great river; sometimes a necessary deluge is required to release you. Before philosophy and organized religion, nature was our only teacher. The greatest inspiration that nature can offer is how it transcends limitations. "Unattached, nothing can ever block your way." ~Kari Hohne (Taoist wisdom)


A river never beats its head against obstacles. It always goes around, and it always gets to the sea. ~Robert Brault, rbrault.blogspot.com

Once in a while we find those people who can be overwhelmed by nothing. They are really luminaries, and the dictionary defines a luminary as a body that gives off light. Some people are pitched head forward into a sea of trouble and come up smiling and strike out for the shore. ~Earl L. Douglas, "Don't eat your heart out," November 1963


So many problems, so many snags
      To untangle every day;
      So many perplexing things in life
      That keep us from being gay!
So many days that are drab and dull
      That we're filled with deepest woe,
      And we give way to discouragement,
      Our dangerous, mortal foe.—
A foe to our joy and happiness,
      A foe to our peace of mind,—
      It's something we all have to conquer
      If contentment we would find!
~Gertrude Tooley Buckingham, "Our Mortal Foe" (1940s)

Turn your face to the sun and the shadows fall behind you. ~Maori Proverb


I've known... lightning strikes and hammer blows, tripping falls face-to-ground. I drag heavy fears... and I've hurt a lot. But why nurture the negative? With each adversity and graying year comes a brighter, giddier laugh and a more sincere, deeper smile. My heart gets both weaker and stronger with each blow, and every knockout convinces me that I don't want to spend any more time, not even mere seconds, being miserable or resentful or smeared with the filth of the past. Wash myself clean each morning and brave the new day.... I'll take what I can get in lessons and give whatever I can in smiles... ~Terri Guillemets, "Kicked Happy, Fallen Grateful," 2012


Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky. ~Rabindranath Tagore

Each morn, as I get out of bed,
      These thoughts keep running through my head:
      "Another day to do my work,
      To do it well and not to shirk;
"Another day to laugh and sing
      That joy to others I may bring;
      Another day of hopes and fears,
      Of happy hours—perhaps, some tears!"
And when, at night, I go to bed,
      I'm always hoping I have shed
      Some sunshine, as I lived the day,
      To help another on his way.
~Gertrude Tooley Buckingham, "Another Day" (1940s)

It will not live but in a loving heart...
It will not stay where scorn and doubt have part...
~Fanny Charlotte Wyndham Montgomery (1820–1893), "When with a tired soul," 1846


So our human life but dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity. ~Henry David Thoreau, Walden

The brilliant stars and moon to gild the night,

Talk happiness.  The world is sad enough
      Without your woe. No path is wholly rough.
      Look for the places that are smooth and clear,
      And speak of them to rest the weary ear
      Of earth; so hurt by one continuous strain
      Of mortal discontent and grief and pain...
Talk health.  The dreary, never-ending tale
      Of mortal maladies is worn and stale;
      You cannot charm or interest or please
      By harping on that minor chord, disease.
      Say you are well, or all is well with you,
      And God shall hear your words and make them true.
~Ella Wheeler Wilcox, "Speech," Poems of Power, 1901

A nasty day! A nasty day!
'Twas thus I heard a critic say
Because the skies were bleak and gray—
And yet it somehow seemed to me
The day was all that it should be.
I looked it very closely o'er;
Its hours still were twenty-four,
With sixty minutes each—no less—
For deeds of good and helpfulness;
And every second full of chance
To give the day significance;
And every hour full of growth
For everybody but the sloth—
I couldn't see it quite that way,
For though the skies were bleak and gray
The day itself, it seemed to me,
Was all a day could rightly be.

I like the man who takes the stones
Upon his rocky road
With smiling lips instead of groans,
Whate'er his heavy load
Who seizes each as on he goes,
And neatly crumbles it,
And turns his share of pebbly woes
To stores of inner grit.
~John Kendrick Bangs (1862-1922), "Transformation" (February Fifteenth), The Cheery Way: A Bit of Verse For Every Day, 1920


[B]eing flexible ensures that you meet with no limitations. It is often in the things you cannot change that you discover life's power to guide you. In a concrete world of mechanical sounds, you may forget that you are a natural creature in the great river of life. When a floating leaf encounters an obstacle, it begins to move in a circle. The potential power captured in the latent energy of the leaf as it turns in circles, reveals how you can access enormous energy by simply letting go. Let go and simply fall back into the great river; sometimes a necessary deluge is required to release you. Before philosophy and organized religion, nature was our only teacher. The greatest inspiration that nature can offer is how it transcends limitations. "Unattached, nothing can ever block your way." ~Kari Hohne (Taoist wisdom)


A river never beats its head against obstacles. It always goes around, and it always gets to the sea. ~Robert Brault, rbrault.blogspot.com


If you call a thing bad you do little, if you call a thing good you do much. ~Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Once in a while we find those people who can be overwhelmed by nothing. They are really luminaries, and the dictionary defines a luminary as a body that gives off light. Some people are pitched head forward into a sea of trouble and come up smiling and strike out for the shore. ~Earl L. Douglas, "Don't eat your heart out," November 1963


So many problems, so many snags
      To untangle every day;
      So many perplexing things in life
      That keep us from being gay!
So many days that are drab and dull
      That we're filled with deepest woe,
      And we give way to discouragement,
      Our dangerous, mortal foe.—
A foe to our joy and happiness,
      A foe to our peace of mind,—
      It's something we all have to conquer
      If contentment we would find!
~Gertrude Tooley Buckingham, "Our Mortal Foe" (1940s)

Am I sorry for me; are you sorry for you;
      And do we grieve for ourselves all the long day through?
      Do we feel that there's no one whom we've ever known
      Who has had so much sorrow, who's been so alone?...
...I will try not to be too sorry for me;
      For, when the shadows fall, God will help me to see.

~Harriet Du Autermont

No road is paved with gold unless you make it your own treasure. ~Alvaro Velasco


To awaken each morning with a smile brightening my face, to greet the day with reverence, for the opportunities it contains; to approach my work with a clean mind; to hold ever before me, even in the doing of little things, the Ultimate Purpose toward which I am working; to meet men and women with laughter on my lips and love in my heart; to be gentle, kind and courteous through all the hours; to approach the night with weariness that ever wooes sleep and the joy that comes from work well done—this is how I desire to waste my days. ~Thomas Dreier

The world is filled with great beauty
      For all God's children to see;
      But many things pass unheeded
      If man holds to jealousy!
All jealousy and all hatred,
      And great bitterness of mind
      Will keep mortal man from searching,
      Nature's loveliness, to find!
His vision becomes distorted;
      He sees only what he thinks:
      If he thinks in terms of darkness,
      Shadows to himself he links!...
He surrounds himself with armor
      That keeps away rainbow lights
      And all harmony of color
      That could make his world so bright!
~Gertrude Tooley Buckingham, "Vibration of Music and Color" (1940s)

I’m exhausted, I need to rest.

Unfortunately, it will be impossible to finish the project on time because of the problems some people are causing with submitting their work late. ? Can everyone turn in their portion of the project by Thursday so that we can complete the work on time and hit the deadline?
I missed you so much!
It’s so great to see you!
I know you like ice cream, but eating too much isn’t healthy.
Nobody trusts you! Has this person done a global survey and checked with everyone on the face of the earth? My guess is that some people trust this person, some don’t and others don’t care. In an effort to attempt to prove the point many people try to include others in their personal perception. A much better critique would be this: “I don’t trust you and here are some specific reasons why.”
You’re fine – no problem – just keep on doing what you are doing. This is not a critique so there should not be a problem. 60% of the time that is true, but 40% of the time this person is merely leading you on and is afraid to honestly tell you the truth.
You always or never! Once again this is a clear over estimate. While the person giving the critique is trying hard to get you to understand the importance of the issue, rather than accepting the feedback, the recipient will most often expend their energy in proving that the “always” or “never” is not true.
Everyone thinks you! Wow, this person can read minds. They know what other people are thinking. When you are guessing the motives, thoughts or opinions of others, you are invariably on dangerous ground.
Look, I am your boss, just do what I say and you will be fine! This is like giving a credit card to a teenager and saying, “don’t spend too much.” No one else can (or should) presume they are able to manage your career for you.
You only care about yourself. You are completely self absorbed! Can another person really know how you feel and understand your motives?
It’s obvious from your question that you don’t understand anything about this issue! In one remark, this person has determined your total ignorance. Most people hearing this feedback will immediately want to prove that they are not totally ignorant. In actual fact, asking questions is an excellent way to learn.
My English is not so good.
You are ugly, and yu are fat
You are stupid, and Kathy is beautifull
Unfortunately I am feeling bad because mi teacher said me: "You can´t do anything good".
I'm sad
It's sad
I was sad
We're sad
I felt sad
Are you sad?
They look sad
It's really sad
That's just so sad
I know you feel sad
Please don't be sad
I don`t shooting in the rivers garbage
My family does not bethe in lakes
My father does not strip the drain solvents
My grandmother does not waste water
The strip much bleach when you make your toilet
I would not waste my shot in the strainers
Nobody gave me flowers
Don't invite anyone
Not one person believed him
I didn't like the museum
I didn't go to the party
There was no food or money
I don't have anyone to help me
You don't ever travel to the mountains
I don’t want to see anyone. I lie in the bedroom with the curtains drawn and nothingness washing over me like a sluggish wave. 
Whatever is happening to me is my own fault. I have done something wrong, something so huge I can’t even see it, something that’s drowning me
I am inadequate and stupid, without worth. I might as well be dead.
I was drawn to all the wrong things: I liked to drink, I was lazy, I didn’t have a god, politics, ideas, ideals.
I was settled into nothingness; a kind of non-being, and I accepted it. I didn’t make for an interesting person.
I didn’t want to be interesting, it was too hard
What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone.
“You say you’re ‘depressed’ – all I see is resilience
You are allowed to feel messed up and inside out
It doesn’t mean you’re defective – it just means you’re huma

I didn’t want to wake up. I was having a much better time asleep.
And that’s really sad. 
It was almost like a reverse nightmare, like when you wake up from a nightmare you’re so relieved. I woke up into a nightmare.
Person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square
The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.
The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors.
It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames.
Passion makes a person stop eating, sleeping, working, feeling at peace. 
A lot of people are frightened because, when it appears, it demolishes all the old things it finds in its path. 
No one wants their life thrown into chaos. 
That is why a lot of people keep that threat under control, and are somehow capable of sustaining a house or a structure that is already rotten. They are the engineers of the superseded.
Some friends don’t understand this. 
They don’t understand how desperate 
I am to have someone say
There is no point treating a depressed person as though she were just feeling sad, saying, ‘There now, hang on, you’ll get over it.’ Sadness is more or less like a head cold- with patience, it passes. Depression is like cancer.
When you’re surrounded by all these people, it can be lonelier than when you’re by yourself. 
You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don’t feel like you can trust anyone or talk to anybody, you feel like you’re really alone.
If you know someone who’s depressed, please resolve never to ask them why. 
Depression isn’t a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather
Depression is like a bruise that never goes away. 
A bruise in your mind.
Depression presents itself as a realism regarding the rottenness of the world in general and the rottenness of your life in particular
But the realism is merely a mask for depression’s actual essence, which is an overwhelming estrangement from humanity.
The more persuaded you are of your unique access to the rottenness, the more afraid you become of engaging with the world; and the less you engage with the world, the more perfidiously happy-faced the rest of humanity seems for continuing to engage with it

Life has many ways of testing a person’s will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once.
“There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle, or the mirror that reflects it.” 
“With everything that has happened to you, you can either feel sorry for yourself or treat what has happened as a gift. Everything is either an opportunity to grow or an obstacle to keep you from growing. You get to choose.”

“If someone tells you, “You can’t” they really mean, “I can’t.”

“You must make a decision that you are going to move on. It wont happen automatically. You will have to rise up and say, ‘I don’t care how hard this is, I don’t care how disappointed I am, I’m not going to let this get the best of me. I’m moving on with my life.”

Life is like a game of chess. To win you have to make a move. Knowing which move to make comes with IN-SIGHT and knowledge, and by learning the lessons that areacculated along the way.
We become each and every piece within the game called life!
Our way of thinking creates good or bad outcomes.
Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover 
Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant.
We don’t see things the way they are. We see them the way WE are
I have found that if you love life, life will love you back.
The reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was, the present worse than it is, and the future less resolved than it will be.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step 
All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make, the better
Too many people spend money they haven’t earned, to buy things they don’t want, to impress people they don’t like.
I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.
Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
Life isn’t a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, chocolate in one hand, latte in the other, body thoroughly used up, totally worn out and screaming ‘Woohoo WHAT A RIDE’!
There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle 
Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security .
You are not in this world to live up to other people’s expectations, nor should you feel the world must live up to yours.
How you do one thing, is how you do everything. Be aware.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one’s definition of your life; define yourself.
Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.
In the end, it’s not going to matter how many breaths you took, but how many moments took your breath away.
The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and let it come in .
You cannot be lonely if you like the person you’re alone with.
Happiness is like a butterfly.
The more you chase it, the more it eludes you.But if you turn your attention to other things,It comes and sits softly on your shoulder.
I think everyone should be told they’re beautiful until they believe it.
People were created to be loved. Things were created to be used. The reason the world is in chaos, is because things are being loved, and people are being used.
Dear Heart, fall in love only when you’re ready, not when you’re lonely 
“It’s impossible” said pride. “It’s risky” said experience. “It’s pointless” said reason. “Give it a try” whispered the heart.
To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage 
If you’re going through hell, keep going 
Feelings come and feelings go. There is no need to fear them and no need to crave them. Let them come, and then let them go. No feeling is your permanent reality, no matter how intense it is.
No matter what, no matter how, where or who - you can almost always turn around and get a second chance
When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us 
The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man - George B Shaw.
You cannot solve a problem with the same mind that created it.
Do or Do Not. There is no Try .
We must let go of the life we had planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us
You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.
Change is inevitable. Progress is optional
Be smart enough to hold on, be brave enough to let go. Sometimes, we need to hold onto faith while letting go of the outcome. Open your hand and hold your dreams gently, don’t try to grab them
If you are irritated by every rub, how will you be polished? - Rumi
If there is anything that we wish to change in the child, we should first examine it and see whether it is not something that could better be changed in ourselves – Carl Jung.
I’ve developed a new philosophy. I only dread one day at a time 
Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there
The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving.
The harder you fall, the higher you bounce
I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I’ve ended up where I needed to be  
The best way to predict the future is to create it
People will hate you, rate you, shake you, and break you. But how strong you stand is what makes you – Unknown.
We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand
You’ve got to do your own growing, no matter how tall your grandfather was
You are who you are and what you are because of what has gone into your mind. You can change who you are and what you are by changing what goes into your mind - Zig Ziglar
Whether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference

“The day is what you make it! So why not make it a great one?”
“Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.”
“Being miserable is a habit; being happy is a habit; and the choice is yours.”
“You cannot tailor-make the situations in life but you can tailor-make the attitudes to fit those situations.”
“Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.”
“We can’t escape pain; we can’t escape the essential nature of our lives. But we do have a choice. We can give in and relent, or we can fight, persevere, and create a life worth living, a noble life. Pain is a fact; our evaluation of it is a choice.”
“Each problem has hidden in it an opportunity so powerful that it literally dwarfs the problem. The greatest success stories were created by people who recognized a problem and turned it into an opportunity.”
“The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude.”
“Optimism is the most important human trait, because it allows us to evolve our ideas, to improve our situation, and to hope for a better tomorrow.”
“I have for many years endeavored to make this vital truth clear; and still people marvel when I tell them that I am happy. They imagine that my limitations weigh heavily upon my spirit, and chain me to the rock of despair. Yet, it seems to me, happiness has very little to do with the senses. If we make up our minds that this is a drab and purposeless universe, it will be that, and nothing else. On the other hand, if we believe that the earth is ours, and that the sun and moon hang in the sky for our delight, there will be joy upon the hills and gladness in the fields because the Artist in our souls glorifies creation. Surely, it gives dignity to life to believe that we are born into this world for noble ends, and that we have a higher destiny than can be accomplished within the narrow limits of this physical life.”
“Nothing truly stops you.  Nothing truly holds you back.  For your own will is always within your control.  Sickness may challenge your body. But are you merely your body? Lameness may impede your legs. But you are not merely your legs. Your will is bigger than your legs. Your will needn’t be affected by an incident unless you let it.”
“Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives.”
“Each morning when I open my eyes I say to myself: I, not events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today. I can choose which it shall be. Yesterday is dead, tomorrow hasn’t arrived yet. I have just one day, today, and I’m going to be happy in it.”
“Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.”
“Welcome every morning with a smile. Look on the new day as another special gift from your Creator, another golden opportunity to complete what you were unable to finish yesterday. Be a self-starter. Let your first hour set the theme of success and positive action that is certain to echo through your entire day. Today will never happen again. Don’t waste it with a false start or no start at all. You were not born to fail.”
